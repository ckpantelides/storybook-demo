# Storybook demo

This repo holds sample code of my upcoming childrens storybook app. (As this is a commercial product I'm not sharing all of the code.)

The demo below shows: the animated homescreen, the character select screen, a sample of the superhero story, and the bookstore that lets you buy a hardback or paperback copy of the story and have it delivered to your door.

The app is built with NativeScript-Angular and will be released in December 2020. There are four professionally illustrated stories, three of which are in-app purchases.
