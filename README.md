# Storybook demo

This repo holds sample code of my upcoming childrens storybook app. (As this is a commercial product I'm not sharing all of the code.)

The app is built with NativeScript-Angular and will be released in December 2020. There are four professionally illustrated stories, three of which are in-app purchases.

The demo below shows: the animated homescreen, the character select screen, a sample of the superhero story, and the bookstore that lets you buy hardback or paperback copies of the stories and have them delivered to your door.
